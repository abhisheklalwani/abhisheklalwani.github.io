I am currently a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.<br>
I like to code pretty much anything and everything.<br> 
I like ML/AI/DL/CV/NLP/ABC/DEF/ETC (like everyone else nowadays), but more importantly, I am passionate about designing and deploying these technology stacks at a practical scale where it can be used to make the life of an end-user somewhat better.<br>
I am a competitive gamer (Valorant FTW!) who also happens to know how ML algorithm works and thus, my work at NVIDIA has revolved around research problems that combine these 2 worlds i.e. gaming and AI (For example, take a look at this). At NVIDIA, I was also responsible for the development of various aspects of the Desktop and the Browser Client of GeForce Now, the state-of-the-art game streaming service by NVIDIA.<br>
My work involved working closely with the UX team as well as the backend team to provide a flawless experience to the end-users.<br>
